87,elisac sprawlgeek privileging of corporate liability shield in politics over positive connection of responsibility to each other
88,elisac sprawlgeek are we to do things together or on our own and how can we do them together with erasure of our uniqueness
89,elisac sprawlgeek i believe it s bigger and broader and older than current tech biz and at core an emotional issue
90,elisac sprawlgeek sustained value dismantling of shared resources and sense of shared involvement ie public education
91,elisac sprawlgeek i think a lot i the problem is in big capital funds the names you don t know the direction to invest in exits vs

93,sprawlgeek elisac mylifeasaghost ripplecreeknw cyberselfish is a book by paulina borsook that saw what was happening in tech first
94,elisac i saw women do the same thing re hollywood casting to prove themselves keep work
95,oy vey the price elisac heathr hey i selected booth babes for our booths and had to act all cool about it notproud
96,ripplecreeknw thanks that s v kind
97,elisac the web felt clearly like it was about people lots of early women inc dooce early blogging pre blogging software was v human
98,elisac that s really interesting early web times felt like a liberal arts nerd table bonanza hardware was a mature biz ie booth babes
99,rt elisac heathr ah see i was in more traditional tech hardware systems not internet during s early oughts super male dominated
100,elisac i was still am part of a group called no end about humanizing but capital has laid waste to those impulses leading
101,elisac it felt better for me as a woman coming to early web valley bc women ourselves were not a product as we re in hollywood
102,elisac but mylifeasaghost wrote cyberselfish early and she saw that impulse first and was right it would rule
103,elisac and the general leftover hippiness that was still in everything as well as the feeling of being at the nerd table earnestness
104,elisac also a culture of sharing information ideas and problem solving still felt that w developers fluentconf this week
105,elisac developers all time time and there was this orientation to education and being open for the most people to be able to use your stuff
106,elisac well i was coming from hollywood it seemed to me that the entire notion of a platform meant people were trying to encourage
107,elisac the earlier tech community felt to me full of caring for each other how do we re centre that make healthiness a goal over scale
108,elisac and all these choices are connected substituting the words choice and freedom for i care about how you re doing
109,elisac this one is even more insidious i think because it s going last longer upside of the downside is that it shows our dehumanization
110,elisac we need a giant relational reboot what does it look like to put the well being of everyone we work with and for first inc us
111,elisac if you are focussed on amazing ux for customers that doesn t create good things for those critical to creating it it s just fetish
112,elisac absolutely and many of those businesses are funded the way they are because they presume no obligation to employees
113,rt elisac heathr this makes me concerned abt sharing or collaborative economy it s an economy for few unless we change social appr
114,elisac otherwise you re just building the matrix to entrap yourself way we use capital is a choice many see it as magically in charge
115,elisac a culture that says how can shines a and tech support a good life for all is what i am interested in
116,me too great talks out there about this from pinboard baconmeteor elisac heathr that sounds like heaven to me lifestylebusiness

119,elisac valley and capital culture in general seek scale above all else what if we put a good life and community first
120,elisac sure or is there also a smaller scale to work on that is more sustainable for a good life
121,rt elisac heathr well exactly it s like being a solo consultant lack of scale exists in any business including that one
122,elisac any blogging at all the mediums don t go away but the way we use them does when culture changes

781,nje i think the culture is due for another break we re heading into beatnik times
782,nje people wanna have a family see them some times make a living not be indebted half their life global economy making that tough
783,nje i don t expect hilary clinton to do anything radically different either as much as the times demand it i hope to be wrong
784,nje the true joy of silicon valley is the gall to imagine things can be entirely different not a great base for the same but more
785,nje early second wave feminism envisioned a really different workplace across the board there were some decent ideas in there
786,nje i predict we ll see media savvy political contenders arise who make sarah palin look cultured and temperate
787,nje i don t see how we get past these parties just ignoring each other worse and worse via kardashian style media moves
788,nje if sandberg had really implemented one big solution on one big issue in her own company i think she d have turned more heads
790,nje only political leader showing any gumption for it is warren or rand and neither looks likely to come middle enough to win
791,nje i mean walmart raised its minimum wage i bet we see more of this kind of thing before the whole system melts apart
792,nje we have massive income inequality driving politics and a corrupt corptocracy with real trouble addressing it trying slowly
793,nje as the ellenpaovkpcb trial and every other facebook thread make clear the problem is so deep dudes don t get they re soaking in it
794,nje for people who want them i don t think the blow back would have been like this
795,nje her basic point re negotiating i completely agree with and if the book and campaign were targeted as some business negotiating tips
796,nje to be fair the problems of our time the corruption problems and corporate america s role are so big its going to be tough to lead
797,nje i imagine she s a profoundly focused person who s insanely capable haven t met her yet but challenged on the communication front
798,nje every time there s a press release look at the careful choice of partners it seems pretty telling there s zero grass roots there
799,ninavizz sure here s mine if he hasn t been in therapy by next guy
800,nje in ye olde gop times i d say she had some kind of libertarian shot in her party but the new gop primary would eat her alive

802,nje i think sandberg has really underestimated the harm this approach will do for her when she runs for office

805,feminist pushback on leanin is bc it s like netanyahu saying in the us congress where he has access he s speaking for all jews he isn t

807,leanin is a calculated effort to bolster female creed and shore up political alliances and grassroots heavily in quotes while
808,current corp culture isn t healthy it s not healthy for women or for men it s certainly not helping have a democracy leanin
809,for any help it does women in corporate america i say zay gezunt i ll always take any good leanin
810,it s the press campaign of speaking for women that doesn t work about sandberg s work and i don t think it ll politically fly
811,sandberg s pr campaign and book is offensive because of it s hypocrisy and underlying buy in to business as usual
812,no no that s not it at all why do people find sandberg s advice so offensive i think it s because she s speaking for herself

1080,tomcoates more subversive and challenging and have a harder time finding public footing bc systemically the whole thing we re in
1081,tomcoates which does like to wag fingers at the middle east now without looking in the mirror i think economic issues are way
1082,tomcoates of all races sexualities that need focus re wage equality need it very badly it s a true disgrace for the us
1083,tomcoates and listening to the entire comments and the context of the movie it s poor women single mums elderly women
1084,tomcoates where the numbers are insane and people mostly have privilege and but my sense is looking at pattyarquette s tweets
1085,tomcoates but women s rights have gotten separated out to some degree i think it s a debate pretty alive in tech hollywood stuff
1086,tomcoates more recent popular focus and political success that makes sense to me of course you can t separate everything out perfectly

1091,tomcoates i couldn t disagree more
1092,tomcoates i m going for generous but im open to the critiques
1093,tomcoates larger point about wage equality is continued and there wd be no gay movement wo feminism i don t think they can be separated
1094,tomcoates but at the end of the day its the kind of moment that does give a chance for more public learning on it but i also hope the
1095,tomcoates the phrase began all women in american includes all women of all colours lesbians trans women anyone who ids as a woman
1096,tomcoates yeah that s a problem and i agree w critique on that for sure but
1097,tomcoates queer struggles are gender struggles
1098,tomcoates what s you queer beef w her statement which oddly sounds like some kind of alternative to kobe beef
1099,but the larger call for an equal rights amedment and for wageequality for all women i hope is picked up by all and worked for
1100,and she s addressing race and wage inequality in her feed doesn t mean she can t be critiqued by all means sure
1101,neither in intent or in what she said all the women in america all the men who love women all the gay people pattyarquette
