# Spam-Detection-and-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Twitter-Data
Spam detection: Spam detection is used to detect unsolicited and unwanted tweets
and prevent those tweets from getting to a user&#39;s inbox. Spam is rarely sent directly by a
company advertising itself. It&#39;s usually sent by a &quot;spammer,&quot; a company in the business of
distributing unsolicited tweets.
Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment Analysis is the most common text classification tool
that analyses an incoming message and tells whether the underlying sentiment is positive,
negative our neutral. It is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts
subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social
sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations.
